Univariate → One variable → Distribution/summary.
Bivariate → Two variables → Relationship/pattern.


UNIVARIATE

1.distributive
Histogram – Frequency of values in bins.
KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) – Smooth curve of probability density.
Violin plot – Mix of KDE + Boxplot to show shape of distribution.

2.summary
Boxplot – Shows median, quartiles, range, and outliers.
Barplot (with summary statistic) – Average values across categories.

BIVARIATE

1.Relationship
Scatter plot → Best for two continuous variables.
Line plot → Shows trend/relationship across time or sequence.
Heatmap → Correlation matrix (strength of linear relationships).

2.pattern
Pairplot (Seaborn) → Helps visualize patterns across multiple variable pairs.
